mount (char *source, char *dest, char *fstype, unsigned long mountflags, const 
       void *data); 
Mount flags : 

MS_BIND 
	- Bind options would be considered later. 
MS_DIRSYNC
	- open with O_SYNC flag applies to all files. MS_DIRSYNC ensures open 
	(pathname, O_CREAT), rename (), link (), unlink (), symlink (), mkdir () 
	are synchrnized without incurring the cost of synchronizing all file 
	accesses. 
	- FS_DIRSYNC_FL : Same utility but can be applied per directory basis. 
	- If we provide, descriptor of directory file to fsync () then we get 
	synchronization per directory basis. Not a standard SuSV3 behaviour. 
MS_MANDLOCK
	- Permits mandatory record locking on the all files in the file system. 
MS_MOVE
	- Mounts subtree pointed to by 'source' argument under the directory 
	pointed to by 'destination' argument. Note that 'source' has already 
	been mounted under some directory in the file system. Therefore, this 
	operation involves unmounting fs-tree pointed to by the 'source' and 
	then remounting it under the directory pointed to by 'target'. 
	- But unmounting and remounting are atomic operations. Therefore, there 
	is no point in time where the source is unmounted. 
	- When this flag is specified last three argument, fstype, mount flags 
	as well as data are ignored. 	
MS_NOATIME
	- This flag causes last time access flag not being updated for the 
	files belonging to this mounted-on file system. 
	- Purpose of this flag is to save extra disk access for updating the 
	inodes of opened file from the file system. This can be used where last 
	access time does not make much of a difference. 
	- FS_NOATIME_FL flag also provides the same functionality, although it 
	can be done on per file basis rather than for the entire file system. 
	- MS_NODIRATIME also does the same thing for the directories belonging 
	mounted-on file system. 
	- O_NOATIME while opening a file using open system also achieves the 
	same objective as described in the above file. 
MS_NODEV
	- This flag causes denied access to the character and the block device 
	files on the mounted-on file system. 
	- This flag is provided for the security purpose. One can insert a 
	removable device containing device files and giving appropriate 
	permissions, he/she can do arbitrary operations in the system being a 
	normal user. Therefore, while mounting any file-system, if we apply 
	MS_NODEV, this hack can be prevented. 
MS_NODIRATIME
	- Same as MS_NOATIME, but only applicable to the directories inside the 
	mounted-on file-system. 
MS_NOEXEC
	- Don't allow scripts and executable on the mounted-on file system to 
	run. 
	- This is useful, if system contains non-Linux executables. 
MS_NOSUID
	- This flag denies running of setuid, setgid bit on programs from the
	source file-system. This is also a security feature like MS_NODEV flag
MS_RDONLY
	- All the files in the mounted-on file systems are read only. That means
	you cannot create files in directories of mounted on file system. As well 
	as you cannot alter the contents of regular files. 
MS_REC
	- Advanced mount options 
MS_RELATIME
	- This feature modifies last access time only if it's current value is less
       than last modified flag. It has some performance benefits of MS_NOATIME. 
	- This is useful flag for programs who need to know when file was recently 
	accessed since the last update. 
	- Since Linux 2.6.30 the last accessed time stamp is always modified if 
	the current accessed time stamp is greater than 24 hours of last updated 
	time stamp even if last accessed time stamp is greater than last update 
	time stamp. 
MS_REMOUNT
	- If this flag is specified then it is required that source is already 
        mounted under the target. In this, fstype argument is ignored and mount
 	flags are set to mount flag argument of the system call. 
	- Normally that would involve unmounting the file system and remounting 
	it. But sometimes, it is not possible to unmount the file system. 
	(i) When processes have opened file from the mounted on file system. 
        (ii) When current directory of a running process is one of the directories	 	  belonging to mounted on file-system. 
MS_STRICTATIME
	- This flag always modifies file access time, no matter what. 	
MS_SYNCHRONOUS
	- Makes all read-write operations on all files in the mounted on file 
	system, synchronous. 
	- This is equivalent to opening all the files in the mounted on file 
	system with O_SYNC flag. 

- Starting from kernel version 2.6.15, Linux has introduced the concept of 
shared subtree. There are some additional flags with respect to this notion. 
MS_PRIVATE, MS_SHARED, MS_SLAVE, MS_UNBINDABLE. 

- Shared subtrees are responsible for enabling some advanced file system features 
e.g. per process mount namespaces, File system in user-space (FUSE).
